# COP 1334 Assignment - Introduction to C++

## Chapter 11 Programming Assignment

## Title: Struct Circle

### Exercise Description:

Create a complete program that defines a structure with

int radius

double circumference

double area

Write functions

getCircleInfo()

calcCircumference

calcArea

displayCircleInfo

## Execution from the Terminal (Alternative way without an IDE):

We must provide to the Compiler the same switches that we usually do in the IDE:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp
```

That will create a file named 'a.out' if you are working in MacOS or a .exe file if you are on Windows. That's the default executable file's name when we don't provide a name.

But we can also specify the name of the resulting executable file:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp -o your_prefered_executable_file_name
```

And in order to run that a.out file, we must execute on the terminal:

```terminal
 % ./a.out
```

## Result of Execution on the Terminal (MacOS example):

```terminal
reinier@reinier % ./your_prefered_executable_file_name

Welcome to Circle Setter Pro

1. Demonstration using a Circle structure variable.
2. Another demonstration using an AlternativeCircle structure variable.
3. Quit the program.

Type your selection please (1 - 3): 1
Type the radius of the circle please (in): 23

A circle with a radius of 23 in has an area of 1,661.90 in² and a circumference of 144.51 in.
